<hr />

<p> <b>RaspCTL</b> is weekend side project. I needed an easy way to control my new Raspberry Pi and I decided to create a web admin for doing so. Basically I wanted to be able to execute <a href="/commands">commands</a> in a easy way, see some <a href="/">statics</a> about what's going on on the RaspPi, and later on I decided that it would be funny add a simple <a href="/webcam">webcam</a> support for taking snapshots and see what's going on in my room when I'm out (always absolutely nothing, of course....) </p>

<p> The main propouse of creating <i>commands</i> was that I always use MOCP player, and I wanted to use the same player in the RaspPI, but connecting thru SSH, run "mocp" command and press "p" for pausing the audio it's annoying and slow. And I decided to create a way to launch commands with a web interface because MOCP supports CLI interaction, so I can lauch "mocp --play" from this webpage and the music will start palying :) (<span class="label label-important">TODO</span> and in a near future I will create an bash script dinamically with the commands already in the system for being able to run this commands without the use of a web interface).</p>

<p> Other stuff pending (<span class="label label-important">TODO</span>) is to create an alarm system for waking me up in the morning with a lovely song. I must be able to set the alarm on/off from the web interface. A online radio or a selected song will start singing at 9 o'clock every morning. That's nice, isn't it?  </p>
